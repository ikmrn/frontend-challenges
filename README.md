### What I learned

Through this initial project from Frontend Mentor, I gained valuable experience in managing multiple projects within a single repository using branches. This approach allowed me to efficiently organize and maintain various solutions while keeping them distinct and easily accessible.

I deepened my understanding of deployment pipelines by leveraging platforms like Netlify to showcase live demos of each project.
This project helped me improve my coding skills and taught me the importance of structured project management.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to further advance my skills in frontend development and improve my skills in animation. I want to explore advanced techniques to create engaging and interactive user experiences.

### Useful resources
