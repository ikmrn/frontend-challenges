## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've been practicing flexbox and CSS positioning techniques to improve my web design skills. Flexbox helps me arrange elements in layouts more efficiently, while CSS positioning allows for precise control over element placement on webpages.

### Continued development

I'm eager to enhance my web development skills by learning Tailwind CSS.
I believe that embracing Tailwind CSS will not only streamline my development process but also empower me to build better user experiences. I look forward to the opportunity to experiment with Tailwind's flexible utility classes
