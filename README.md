### What I learned

During this project, I gained valuable experience in state management by implementing state changes for different components. Specifically, I learned how to create a rating component from scratch, which involved handling user interactions to select a rating option and dynamically updating the UI based on the user's choice.

I deepened my understanding of web forms by learning how to prevent form submission when certain conditions are not met. This knowledge is crucial for ensuring data integrity and providing a smooth user experience.

Additionally, I delved into dynamically generating HTML elements with JavaScript, improving code efficiency and maintainability while adhering to standardized practices.

Overall, this project provided me with practical hands-on experience in front-end development, reinforcing key concepts such as state management and form handling.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to further enhance my understanding of web development practices, particularly in areas related to security. I am eager to explore topics such as secure coding practices, data validation, and protecting against common security threats. Additionally, I plan to continue refining my skills in front-end development and exploring advanced techniques to create more robust and user-friendly web applications.
