## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript for interactivity
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to create filters to organize and manage data effectively. Additionally, I practiced building dynamic HTML elements to create more interactive web pages. Importing data from JSON files taught me how to integrate external data sources seamlessly into my projects. Overall, these experiences have expanded my understanding of web development and equipped me with valuable skills for future projects.

### Continued development

Now, I want to add more to it. I'm thinking of incorporating advanced features like sorting and searching to make it easier to browse data. I also want to try using new tools like React or Vue.js to make my website more interactive. It would be great to include real-time updates from other websites using APIs and make my data look better with charts and graphs.
