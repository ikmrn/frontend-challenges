## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript for interactivity
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices

### What I learned

I gained experience in manipulating SVG images and creating sprites from them. This allowed me to enhance the visual elements of my projects and optimize performance by reducing the number of HTTP requests.

My understanding of CSS transitions deepened as I explored various transition effects and techniques. Experimenting with Bezier curves enabled me to fine-tune animation timing and easing, resulting in smoother and more dynamic user interfaces.

### Continued development

As I continue to develop my skills, I plan to explore more advanced CSS transition techniques to enhance user experiences. Additionally, I'm interested in incorporating type checking into my projects, with TypeScript. This approach will help improve code reliability and maintainability, contributing to the overall quality of my development work.
