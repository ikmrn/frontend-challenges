## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project, I gained insight into the challenges and time-consuming nature of naming conventions. Previously, while working on Python projects, I underestimated the difficulty of naming and couldn't comprehend why it was such a common topic of discussion. However, through this project, I experienced firsthand the struggle of finding the right names and the frustration of spending hours on naming and renaming tasks.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I aim to explore techniques to streamline the naming process and reduce the time spent on it. One avenue I plan to explore is Tailwind CSS, which offers utility classes that can simplify styling and potentially reduce the need for custom naming conventions.

Additionally, I will focus on refining my naming practices to achieve greater clarity, conciseness, and consistency in my code. This includes reviewing and adjusting naming conventions where necessary to improve readability and maintainability.
