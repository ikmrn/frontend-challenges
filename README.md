## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Only HTML and CSS (NO JavaScript used)

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to use HTML's `details` and `summary` elements to make collapsible sections, which can neatly organize content on a webpage. I also picked up a handy trick in CSS that allows me to change image sources dynamically, making my designs more flexible. Plus, I got some good practice in placing background images, adding some visual flair to my projects.

### Continued development

In my future projects, I aim to continue adopting simpler solutions whenever possible, just like I did in this project where I managed to create an accordion without relying on JavaScript. This approach not only simplifies the codebase but also enhances the accessibility and performance of the web application. I believe that prioritizing simplicity in problem-solving leads to more maintainable and user-friendly solutions overall.
