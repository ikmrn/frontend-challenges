## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Tailwind

### What I learned

In this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how Tailwind CSS operates and encountered challenges associated with dynamically adding classes, which are not compiled during build time.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I aim to delve into the intricacies of compiling Tailwind CSS in real time. If there an opportunity for dynamic style generation I will certainly try Just-in-Time mode
